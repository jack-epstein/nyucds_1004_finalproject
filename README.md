# NYU_CDS_1004_FinalProject

This is a sample of the repository for my team's NYU Big Data Project. In the project we built a Song Recommender System using Spark. The code in this repository are the elements of the projects for which I was primarily responsible, so were either written by me or included noticeable contributions from me. Due to this, the repository does not contain all of the code that went into the final project.

I did not include any of the data used in this repository. The majority came from HDFS, housed on NYU's High Performance Computing Cluster. Initially it came from the Million Songs Dataset http://millionsongdataset.com/

The final PDF is shared here: put link when ready
